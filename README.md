# Academic Program Website (Web Support Demo)

This project is a multi-page academic-style website created to demonstrate
basic web support and content maintenance skills in a university environment.

## Purpose
The site simulates an academic programme website similar to those used by
university colleges or departments. It focuses on clarity, consistency,
and template-based page maintenance rather than advanced design.

## Features
- Multi-page structure (Home, About, Programs, Events, Contact)
- Shared navigation bar across all pages
- Content-heavy pages for realistic updates and proofreading
- Consistent styling using a single CSS file
- Deployed using GitHub Pages

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTML and CSS for webpage structure and styling
- Template-based webpage building
- Content editing and proofreading
- Basic Git workflow (commit, push, deploy)
- Live deployment using GitHub Pages

## Notes
This project was built as part of preparation for a Web Support / Student
Associate role, focusing on safe and maintainable website updates.
